# Tegari-back-end

This project is aimed at tackling the rampant scams on customer to customer sell websites such as Ebay or Gumtree by implementing a user point system and a report system. This is the backend of that project.

Built as an API with Ruby on Rails it makes use of Active Record to interact with a Postgres Database.

All of this was done as part of my last project at Flatiron School
